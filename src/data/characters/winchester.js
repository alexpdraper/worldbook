After getting tied up in a criminal ring he longed to return to his family and began to search for them. Shortly into his search he somehow ended up in the natural world. After protecting a family of locksmiths from a mugging, they took him in, and he has worked with them ever since. While he appreciates the family he has found, he longs to return home.',
